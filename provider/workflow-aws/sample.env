#
# Basic use: duplicate this file, and make sure the new copy is also in the root of the AWS
# 'provider' folder, and name it `.env`. Note that on macOS, by default, files starting with
# are considered hidden system files, and are not displayed by default in Finder or the file
# selector (which you will need to use when adding the environment file(s) to the run
# configuration(s). While you can change a setting to show hidden files and folders by
# default, there is also a keyboard shortcut to quickly toggle between hide/show. With either
# Finder as the active application ("Finder" appears next to the Apple logo in the Menu Bar),
# press: command + shift + . (period). You can store configurations for multiple environments
# by adding more duplicates following a naming scheme of your choosing, for example:
# `staging.env`, `uat.env`, or `local.env`.
#
# This requires installing a plugin to your IDE that allows you to use a .env
# file in your repository folder (does NOT get checked into source control;
# only the sample environment configuration (sample.env) should be committed.
