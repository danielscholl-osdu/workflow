# Welcome to the OSDU SPI Management System!

Thank you for creating a repository from the **OSDU SPI Management Template**!

Welcome to the OSDU SPI Management Template! This template will help you maintain a long-lived fork of an upstream OSDU repository.

## Next Steps

To complete the initialization of your fork management repository, please provide the upstream repository you want to fork from.

### Supported Formats

**GitHub Repository:**
```
owner/repository-name
```
Example: `microsoft/OSDU` or `Azure/osdu-infrastructure`

**GitLab Repository:**
```
https://gitlab.company.com/group/repository-name
```

### Instructions

1. **Reply to this issue** with just the repository reference (one of the formats above)
2. The automation will validate your input and begin the setup process
3. You'll receive updates as the initialization progresses
4. Once complete, this issue will be automatically closed

### What happens during initialization?

- Configure the three-branch structure (`main`, `fork_upstream`, `fork_integration`)
- Set up branch protection rules
- Configure upstream repository connection
- Enable automated sync workflows
- Set up security scanning and dependabot
